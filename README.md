# Linear-Regression

This repository contains the solution to the exercises on Linear Regression in the Machine Learning Course taught by Andrew NG.

Here, I present two variants of Linear Regression.

(1) Linear Regression with single variable (univariate) - Here we only consider the effect of a single feature affecting our outcome.

(2) Linear Regression with multiple variables/features (multi variate) - Here, we consider the effect of multiple features and their influence on the estimated output.

We use a linear cost function Y = W0 + W1.X and perform gradient descent to minimize the cost.
The solutions are presented in Jupyter notebook alongwith comments and illustrations where possible.
